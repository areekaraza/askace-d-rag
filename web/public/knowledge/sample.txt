AskAce RAG (Static GitHub Pages Version)

This is a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that runs entirely in the browser for retrieval.

How it works:
1) The app loads text files from the /knowledge folder.
2) It splits them into chunks.
3) It builds a TF-IDF index and retrieves the most relevant chunks for your question.
4) It sends your question + retrieved context to a Hugging Face model.

Privacy and cost:
- Retrieval happens locally in your browser.
- Generation uses the Hugging Face Inference API.
- You provide your Hugging Face API token at runtime (stored in your browser localStorage).
