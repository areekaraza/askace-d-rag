CCP (Parallel & Distributed Computing) - Sample Notes

- Speedup (S) is defined as: S = T_serial / T_parallel.
- Amdahl's Law: S_max = 1 / ((1 - p) + p / N)
  where p is the parallel fraction and N is the number of processors.
- Common communication patterns: broadcast, scatter, gather, reduce.
